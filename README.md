# Can_DDPMs_Beat_GANs
This repository contains the code for the project "Can DDPMs really beat GANson conditional medical image synthesis?" on the course CS236 - Deep Generative Models at Stanford. The code enables performing inference and training on conditional DDPM. In inference time, the model takes as input the source-contrast image and produces the target-contrast image. We acknowledge that with adaptations to the image synthesis task in MRI, the code is mainly based on the unofficial implementation of the [SR3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07636.pdf) paper in the [repository](https://github.com/Janspiry/Image-Super-Resolution-via-Iterative-Refinement).
